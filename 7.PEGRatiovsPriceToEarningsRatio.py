# PEG=(P/E)/EGR  P/E = Price/EPS  #EGR=>Earnings growth rate
# if PEG^ => stock overvalued
# if PEG low => stock undervalued

#Eg:        company A       company B
#Price          $50            $50
#EPS            2.50           5.0
#P/E            20             10   
#EGR            20%            5%
#------------------------------------
#PEG            1              2

#according to P/E B is undervalued 
#but according PEG A is undervalued

#PEG is better than P/E because it cantain EGR(how fast a company can grow its earning) param hence give a better overview

# !! It is not gurantee but just a prediction !!
